Ever wondered what it would be like to start a revolution? Strange question to ask on the first date darling, but I will answer. 

Destroy the imperial monarchy to replace it with your own version of a dictatorship, or reinstate civilian rule.

You have multiple paths for a revolution. You can plan carefully or you can brute force your way in. Either way, it will be bloody.
