TEXT REVOLUTION
Have you ever wondered what it would be like to start a revolution? It's a strange question to ask on a first date, but let's explore it together.

In Text Revolution, you have the power to destroy the imperial monarchy and replace it with your own version of a dictatorship, or even reinstate civilian rule. The fate of the nation is in your hands.

Choose Your Path
There are multiple paths to take in Text Revolution. You can carefully plan and strategize your way to victory, or you can take a more aggressive approach and brute force your way in. Either way, it will be a bloody battle.

The Power of Words
In Text Revolution, your words are your most powerful weapon. Use them to sway the hearts and minds of the people, or to incite them to take up arms and fight for your cause. But be careful - your words can also backfire and turn the people against you.

The Stakes Are High
The fate of the nation rests on your shoulders. Will you lead your people to a brighter future, or will you plunge them into darkness and despair? The choices you make will have far-reaching consequences.
